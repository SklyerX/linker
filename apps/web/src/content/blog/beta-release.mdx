### Hello world!

Today I am glad to announce Linker has been launched!

I always had an issue when surfing the web. I'd find something that I was looking for and
I'd paste the link in a new tab. I'd go searching around some more and I'd find more links.
After a while I had a bunch of tabs open. When I had to get back to the things that I needed tho...
That was a struggle. Between all these tabs my Chrome Browser kept freezing and giving me `Error Type 5`
which means too many tabs open and I'd get really mad because now there was no way to get my links back. I'd have to close all the tabs and find the links again but this time actaully save it somewhere else

Whenever I start a project (like this one) I always have a lot of tabs open. Looking up docs, having my music there, and previewing the app.
Things always got messy when I had to search for a package because between all those tabs it was really hard to find what I was looking for.

Another issue that I faced was sharing links. I'm in development team and I also work as a freelancer. I always need a place to store links or share long links. I couldn't find a consistant way to do so.

Therefore, I built this app!

Keep it in mind it is still the beta release and things will change in the near future. Also I am not getting paid to operate this project so if updates are slow please excuse me. However, if you want a change in this app but don't have the paitence to wait why not make it yourself? You can contribute [here](https://github.com/SklyerX/linker)

### Building Blocks

Linker provides a bunch of features out of the box to help your browsing experience better,
here's some examples:

#### Unordered Links

Store random links that you might need.

#### Grouped Links

Create groups and store your links in specific groups so you can stay organized and on top of everything.

#### Markdown / Notes

Write some notes for yourself. Need to write about your day, your feelings, are you doing okay? (no really are you?)

#### Chrome

There are two things (as of right now) that you can do in the chrome section

- **Bookmarks** - Import all your bookmarks through the browser extension and easily view and search through them

- **Tabs** - For those who are like me, use the extension and get all of your open tabs and import them into their own little group

#### Link Shortner

If you have a really really really really really long link, you can easily shorten it and sent it to anyone on the web. (analytics coming soon)

#### Settings

Finally, the settings. The place where everything comes together. Easily import and export your account, change themes, and manage account. It's so easy even your baby cousin can do it tsk..tsk..tsk
