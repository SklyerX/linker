### Meet Linker

Linker is a website link manager / saver. It allows you to easily manage your links in one place and keep order of all the important things you come across on the web.

Beside being an swiss army link manager, Linker is built to make your life easier so the next time you know you need that one site but can't recall the URL you can easily type it.

Create groups and organize your links in a modern way. Effortlessly import all your active tabs and read through them. You can even import all of them at once to a whole new group!
